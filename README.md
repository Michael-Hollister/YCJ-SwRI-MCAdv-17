# Youth Code Jam - SwRI Minecraft Advanced Camp 2017

This page contains information about how to continue developing your mod from this camp and lists some additional resources for learning Java and Minecraft Modding.

Above is a folder called `Student Projects`, which contains the source code for the mods of some students who requested to download their work later. The easiest way to download the source files for your mod is by clicking the green `Clone or download` button, and selecting `Download ZIP`.

## Continuing Development of Student Mods

To continue development of your mod, you should first install the required software. Please install and setup the required software by following this guide at https://github.com/MinecraftU/mcu-curriculum/blob/master/level_5/section_0.md.

After you have completed the installing, getting started, and testing sections, you may copy the `src` folder of your mod into your modding project. You should then be able to continue developing your mod from this camp.

Finally, the guide mentioned above also tells you how to build your mod so you can play it on Minecraft without running it from IntelliJ. If you do not know how to install mods, you can search online how to install Minecraft Forge mods, or use a third-party Minecraft launcher (e.g. MultiMC) to make mod installation easier.

## Additional Resources

### Java

It is recommended to fully learn Java before learning more advanced topics in Minecraft Modding. Below are various free online courses, that teach Java. All these courses cover mostly the same topics, so feel free to choose the one to your liking.

### Minecraft Modding (1.7.10)

Below are some resources that teach the basics of Minecraft Modding. The last two links contain some information about modding Minecraft 1.8 (which has a few significant changes from modding in 1.7.10), but also contains tutorials of advanced topics for modding Minecraft 1.7.10.

If there is a topic/feature you want to implement in your mod that is not covered by these tutorials or searching online, I recommend browsing for open-source mods that implement a similar feature that you want to program in your own mod.
